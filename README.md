[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-first-array-last/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-first-array-last) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-first-array-last/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-first-array-last) [![PHP Version Require](https://poser.pugx.org/polyfills/array-first-array-last/require/php)](https://packagist.org/packages/polyfills/array-first-array-last)

Provides user-land PHP polyfills for the `array_first` and `array_last` functions added in PHP 8.5.

Requires PHP 7.3 or later. Not supported on PHP 8.5 because these functions are natively implemented in PHP 8.5.

## Installation

```bash
composer require polyfills/array-first-array-last
```

## Usage

Simply use the `array_first` and `array_last` functions as if they were declared already.
